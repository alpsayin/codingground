# Raffle Win Probability Calculator
This is a script that I wrote to calculate the winning probabilities for an easter raffle. People choose number(s) between inclusive 1-100. During the draw if an unclaimed number is picked it's discarded and a new one is picked. The script computes the win probabilities in two ways; first using the probability theories (Bayesian), and then statistically (simulating a substantial amount of raffles).

This was basically an exercise for me to remember the subject of dependent probability and just a way to kill some time.
